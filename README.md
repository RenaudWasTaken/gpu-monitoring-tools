# NVIDIA GPU Monitoring Tools

## Bindings

This Github repository contains Golang bindings for the following two libraries:
- [NVIDIA Management Library (NVML)](https://docs.nvidia.com/deploy/nvml-api/nvml-api-reference.html#nvml-api-reference) is a C-based API for monitoring and managing NVIDIA GPU devices.
- [NVIDIA Data Center GPU Manager (DCGM)](https://developer.nvidia.com/data-center-gpu-manager-dcgm) is a set of tools for managing and monitoring NVIDIA GPUs in cluster environments. It's a low overhead tool suite that performs a variety of functions on each host system including active health monitoring, diagnostics, system validation, policies, power and clock management, group configuration and accounting.

You will also find samples for both of these bindings in this repository.
